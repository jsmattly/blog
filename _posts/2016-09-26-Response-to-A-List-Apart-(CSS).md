CSS is essential to learn for designing websites. 
Today, we define objects, create semantic, descriptive, and meaningful CSS
for the best modern markup. Which is why we should have more meaningful CSS style.

Since CSS has to work with HTML, we have to get familiarized with HTML. 
Every element in HTML has a very specific, agreed-upon meaning, and attributes. 
Fulfilling these kinds of strict characteristics of HTML, we nest "div" inside "div" inside "div".
We need to look at CSS more carefuly, and look at classes that provice insight into what we are defining,
because we need good semantic and meaningful markup.

I know that in coding, if we don't have "good code", it's messy.
Same thing for CSS. There are semantics, logics, and meanings. If we don't try to keep it stylized and legible, it's going to get messy.
Being lazy would not be acceptable for designing websites.
Imagine working with groups trying to work on CSS together and it's messy.
I'm going to get fired.
