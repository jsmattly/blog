Navigation is one of the fundamental things that we have to take into consideration while designing a website. Navigation isn't just links. Navigation is "like most elements of a website, about communicating with the user." Good navigation entails good stories which have beginning, middle and end. Naviation also has three contextual parts which are used to communicate to the users about the past, present, and future. 

These factors are important because the website is trying to sell things, or convince users to come back and navigation is a key factors for visitors to revisit the website if you're trustworthy or not. The article defines three simple guidelines:

1. Never link to the page you're on
2. Show wher eyou are
3. Think before you link

Visual langauge nees to be consistent. For example, tabs can tell you where you are, and underline is always present on hover, and certain consistant color such as (blue) means it's clickable. We have to think about symbolic meanings of visual metaphors like tabs, and think about our information architecture. If you want your users to have good experience and make them want to come back, good navigation is one of the key elements to the attraction.
